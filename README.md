## Introduction

In this repository, you will find various DSA implementations, explanations, and examples that I have learned and collected. My goal is to continuously update and expand this repository to cover a wide range of DSA topics.

## Contents

The repository is organized into different directories, each dedicated to a specific DSA topic. Here's an overview of what you can expect to find:

- **[Array](/array)**: Implementations and explanations related to arrays.
- **[Linked List](/linked-list)**: Data structures and algorithms related to linked lists.
- **[Stack](/stack)**: Stack data structure and relevant algorithms.
- **[Queue](/queue)**: Queue data structure and relevant algorithms.
- **[Trees](/trees)**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal algorithms.
- **[Sorting Algorithms](/sorting-algorithms)**: Various sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, etc.
- **[Searching Algorithms](/searching-algorithms)**: Different searching algorithms like binary search, linear search, etc.

Please explore these directories to access the code implementations, explanations, and examples.
